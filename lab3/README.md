This experiment aims to create a Tic Tac Toe (TTT) game using a C program. To plan for it, a flowchart is created that details the progression of the code. Firstly, a 3x3 game board is created to facilitate the gameplay. The user is then prompted to enter their move, and the program displays the corresponding location of their piece on the game board if the space is not occupied. Furthermore, the program includes a random placement function for the computer's moves, allowing for dynamic gameplay. The randomized computer play also checks if the slot is occupied. Otherwise, it will keep generating a random position. The game continues until one of the players achieves three “Xs” in a row, column or diagonally or when all the slots on the board are filled. The program incorporates several programming techniques, including the use of a switch case at least once and the implementation of at least one user-defined function. Additionally, the program ensures that players can only place their pieces in empty slots, notifying them of any placement errors and requesting a valid location input. Finally, the program accurately determines the outcome of the game, declaring whether the player has won, lost, or if the game resulted in a tie.
