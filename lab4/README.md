The experiment aims to build a treasure hunt game using a C program. The user plays this game by moving the cursor (which starts at the upper right corner of the map) around the map to collect randomly generated treasures at different locations. A flowchart is created that details the progression of the code. Firstly, the walls and interiors of the treasure hunt map are created. A timer is started, and then the user is prompted to enter their move. Moving through the map uses the ”W”, “A”, “S” and “D” keys commonly found in computer games for character navigation. The user’s movement will be displayed on the board accordingly. The program will continue asking the user to enter a move whilst displaying their move on the board until they reach a treasure which is represented by an ”@” character.  Once collected, the “@” character will turn into a “.”. This process will repeat until all treasures are collected. The timer decides if the user wins or loses by comparing the time it took for all treasures to be collected to a set time frame.
